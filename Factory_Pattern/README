============================================================
Factory pattern is one of most used design pattern in Java. 
This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

Implementation

We're going to create a Shape interface and concrete classes implementing the Shape interface. 
A factory class ShapeFactory is defined as a next step.

FactoryPatternDemo, our demo class will use ShapeFactory to get a Shape object. 
It will pass information (CIRCLE / RECTANGLE / SQUARE) to ShapeFactory to get the type of object it needs.

===========================================================================================================

Step 1
Create an interface.
Shape.java

Step 2
Create concrete classes implementing the same interface.

Rectangle.java
Square.java
Circle.java

Step 3
Create a Factory to generate object of concrete class based on given information.
ShapeFactory.java

Step 4
Use the Factory to get object of concrete class by passing an information such as type.
FactoryPatternDemo.java

Step 5
Verify the output.
